[Presentation](http://jdiedrick.github.io/timeisoftheseesnce/presentation/#/)

The use of time is essential in any artistic practice. In this workshop, we will learn how to use time within the context of interactive art to create works with elements of tension, suspense and surprise. This workshop is meant to serve two-purposes: To explore interactive arts and the techniques used to manipulate time, including delay, repetition, duration, looping, and resetting. And, to learn about some of the technologies that serve as the foundation for interactive art. At the end of the workshop you will be able to start building your own tools and platforms.

We will be working with Arduino, an open-source hardware and software platform that enables artists to create works that interact with people, the environment, and other computers. We will learn basics electronics and programming skills so that youâ€™ll be able to make works that sense and respond to the world and unfold over time.

Over the course of this six hour workshop, we will:

- Look at time-based interactive works of art
- Introduce Arduino and the concepts behind physical computing
- Demonstate basic possibilities with the Arduino
- Present ways to incorporate time into Aruino
- Present ideas for small, modest project to make
- Work on a small project
- Present projects to each other

What to bring:

Just your laptop, if you have one. If you don't, please let us know and we can do what we can to accomidate you! Arduino is a free, open-source software and it works on most of the big operating systems (OS X, Windows and Linux), so as long as you have a laptop we are good to go. 

Special thanks to Pamela Takefman, Francis Tseng and Fei Liu for helping develop this workshop.
