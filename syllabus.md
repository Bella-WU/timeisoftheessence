# Part 2: 

- Overview of Arduino

- Installing Arduino
	- Walkthrough of setting up blink
		- Wire up LED on breadboard
			- Diagram of schematic
		- Connect to Arduino
		- Connect Arduino to computer

- Look at examples and walk through the code

# Part 3: Time-Based Examples

## Delay
	- delay()
	- add LED
	- Variables
	- delay example
	- https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Delay

## Duration
	- change length of delay with potentiometer
	- add potentiometer
	- Analog In example
	- https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInput

##  Repetition
	- If condition
	- Using a for-loop
	- Blink Repetition
	- Servo example 

## Counting
	- how many times a button is pressed, do something after a certain amount of time 
	- Wire up button
	- variables
	- if statement
	- not conditional
	- state change detection example
	- https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/StateChangeDetection?from=Tutorial.ButtonStateChange

## Resetting
	- introduce audio
	- Audio
	- Introduce state changing with audio and reset function
	- ** Change audio speed with potentiometer**
	- https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ToneMelody

## Elapsed Time
	- Show what happens if you use delay, blocks other commands
	- Comments
	- blink without delay example

## Real time 

	Using the real time:

	http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/DateTime

	while statements:
		- if it is today's date, turn an LED on

	You can potentially do it for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years etc
