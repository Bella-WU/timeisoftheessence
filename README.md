The use of time is essential in any artistic practice. In this workshop, we will learn how to use time within the context of interactive art to create works with elements of tension, suspense and surprise. This workshop is meant to serve two-purposes: From one angle, we will explore interactive arts and the techniques used to explore the concept of time, including delay, repetition, duration, looping, and resetting. We will also learn just enough about the technology behind interactive art so you can start getting yourself in trouble. We will be working with Arduino, an open-source hardware and software platform that gives you the tools necessary to create works that interact with people, the enviroment, and even other computers. With a little bit of electronics and a tiny pinch of programming, you'll be able to make works that sense the world and respond in ways that fit whatever idea you have in mind.

Over the course of this six hour workshop, we will:

- Look at time-based interactive works of art
- Introduce Arduino and the concepts behind physical computing
- Demonstate basic possibilities with the Arduino
- Present ways to incorporate time into Aruino
- Present ideas for small, modest project to make

Break

- Work on a small project
- Present projects to each other


Cost: $150 (includes Arduino starter kit) 

What to bring:

Just your laptop, if you have one. If you don't, please let us know and we can do what we can to accomidate you! Arduino is a free, open-source software and it works on most of the big operating systems (OS X, Windows and Linux), so as long as you have a laptop we are good to go.
